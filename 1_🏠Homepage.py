              and ozone can lead to respiratory issues, including asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term exposure is linked to increased rates of cardiovascular diseases, strokes, and lung cancer. Children, the elderly, and individuals with preexisting health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Moreover, air pollution can exacerbate existing health issues, leading to increased hospital admissions and healthcare costs. There is also emerging evidence suggesting that air pollution may impact mental health and cognitive functions, indicating that its effects are even more widespread than previously understood. Reducing air pollution levels is crucial for public health improvement.")
